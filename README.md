# BASH SCRIPTING  
Bash scripting is the practice of writing scripts, or sequences of commands, in the Bash shell language to automate tasks on Unix-based systems (like Linux and macOS). Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system through text commands.
